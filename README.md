## 📝 AI Development Session Documentation

### Daily Prompts & Enhancement Requests

This section documents all the prompts and requests made during the AI-assisted development session for comprehensive project tracking and future reference.

#### **Session Date**: August 4, 2025

#### **Initial Setup & Documentation**
1. **README Enhancement Request**:
   ```
   "Please update my read.me file and mention that this generated by Cursor-AI and prompt used to generated by AI"
   ```

#### **Core Data to API Migration**
2. **Major Architecture Refactoring**:
   ```
   "in this iOS app built using VIPER architecture. The app currently uses Core Data to store and display items. I need you to: 
   1. Remove all Core Data-related code from the project (Core Data stack, entities, fetch requests, save/delete logic). 
   2. Replace Core Data with API calls to fetch data from a server. 
   3. Modify the Interactor layer to handle API requests using URLSession or async/await. 
   4. Update the Presenter to pass the API data to the View. 
   5. Ensure the View displays the data received from the Presenter without any Core Data dependencies. 
   6. Keep Cart and Wishlist state management using in-memory data (e.g. stored in Interactor or a dedicated manager class). 
   7. Update the Router only if needed for navigation changes. 
   9. Do not change the UI layout or navigation flow; only replace the data source logic. 
   10. Remove all Core Data imports and related files while ensuring the app compiles successfully after the refactor. 
   The goal is to fetch and display data from the server directly within the VIPER flow instead of Core Data. After code change build code also"
   ```

#### **UI Layout Fixes**
3. **Collection View Overlap Issue**:
   ```
   "welcome page UI collection view over lapping littile bit please fix."
   ```

4. **Grid to List View Conversion**:
   ```
   "Change on welcome page grid view to list view."
   ```

5. **Comprehensive UI Layout Fixes**:
   ```
   "In my existing iOS app (Swift, VIPER architecture), fix the following UI issues:

   1. On the Welcome Page:
      - The collection view cells are overlapping each other.
      - Add a 10px spacing between cells and also ensure proper padding from the screen edges.

   2. On the Detail Page:
      - Some buttons and icons are getting cut off on the sides.
      - Add safe area padding or appropriate constraints so that all elements are visible properly.

   Requirements:
   - Apply these changes using Auto Layout or SwiftUI spacing if applicable (based on the existing implementation).
   - Do not modify the navigation structure or Core Data/API logic.
   - Only fix layout issues.
   - Ensure the UI adapts properly on different iPhone screen sizes."
   ```

6. **Width-Specific Layout Adjustments**:
   ```
   "Nope now looking mo bad previsly hight is ok . issue with width work on width."
   ```

7. **Side Spacing Issues**:
   ```
   "No not correct and also not spacing from side also in both page welcom and detail page."
   ```

#### **Major Feature Enhancement Request**
8. **Comprehensive App Extension**:
   ```
   "existing iOS app built in Swift using VIPER architecture. The app currently has:
   - A Welcome Page displaying product items.
   - A Product Detail Page.

   I need to extend this app with the following new features:

   1. Sign-In Feature:
      - Create a Sign-In screen with email and password fields.
      - Add "Sign In" and "Register" buttons.
      - On successful sign-in, store the authentication token in memory or UserDefaults (no Core Data).
      - Show an error alert for invalid login credentials.
      - After successful login, navigate to the Welcome Page.

   2. Menu / Order History:
      - Add a "Menu" button (hamburger icon) on the Welcome Page that opens a side menu or a new screen.
      - In the menu, add an "Order History" option.
      - Create an Order History screen that displays a list of previous orders (fetched from API).
        Each order should include:
          - Order ID
          - Date
          - Total Price
          - Status
      - Tapping an order should navigate to an Order Detail screen showing the order items.

   3. Product Categories:
      - On the Welcome Page, add a horizontal category selector or a separate Category screen.
      - Categories should be fetched from the API.
      - Display products based on the selected category.
      - Each category should include:
          - ID
          - Name
          - Image (optional)
      - Ensure smooth navigation between categories without breaking the existing product detail flow.

   4. General:
      - Keep the existing VIPER architecture.
      - Create separate modules for Sign-In, Menu, Order History, and Categories (VIPER modules).
      - Use URLSession or async/await for API requests.
      - No Core Data; use API-driven data fetching.
      - UI should use Auto Layout and adapt to all iPhone screen sizes.
      - Keep Cart and Wishlist features working as they are."
   ```

9. **Git Operations** (Multiple requests):
   ```
   "commit and push the changes"
   "commit and push"
   "check again"
   "git push"
   ```

10. **Session Continuation** (Multiple requests):
